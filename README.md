## Beyond the Basics Demos

The code in the scripts directory is meant to be run in F# Interactive (FSI).

I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide-FSharp](http://ionide.io/) extension.

I customize the keybindings for sending script text to FSI. I do this for consistency between VS Code and Visual Studio.
[My Bnindings](https://github.com/shanecharles/vscode-settings/blob/master/keybindings.json)
- `Ctrl + '` 
  - executes a line the cursor is situated on
- `Ctrl + ;` 
  - executes the selected text (multi line)
- `Ctrl + i`
  - Starts/Resets FSI
